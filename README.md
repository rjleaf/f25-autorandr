# f25-autorandr
Autorandr for Fedora 25/26

**Note: This version of autorandr does not require pm-utils to be installed.**

Many copr repositories have a version of autorandr that requires pm-utils to be installed, which prevents installation of other builds of autorandr on newer versions of Fedora.
